      Codingal is an online platform designed to teach coding to students,
      particularly younger learners, through engaging and interactive lessons.
      It offers a structured curriculum covering languages like Python and Java,

      their progress. By fostering creativity and critical thinking, Codingal
      not only equips learners with essential programming skills but also
